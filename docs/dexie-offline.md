# Dexie Offline Functionality

## Introduction
Dexie is a wrapper for IndexedDB, providing a simple and powerful API for managing offline data storage in web applications. This document outlines how to implement offline functionality using Dexie in the Linknote project.

## Setting Up Dexie
To get started with Dexie, you need to install the Dexie library. If you haven't already, add it to your project:

```bash
pnpm add dexie
```

### Creating a Dexie Database
Create a new file for your Dexie database configuration, for example, `src/db/index.ts`. Here’s a basic setup:

```typescript
import Dexie from 'dexie';

const db = new Dexie('LinknoteDatabase');

db.version(1).stores({
  links: '++id, url, title, tags',
  tags: '++id, name',
});

export default db;
```

## Handling Offline Operations
With Dexie set up, you can now perform CRUD operations while offline. Here’s how to handle adding a link:

### Adding a Link
When the user adds a link, you can store it in Dexie:

```typescript
import db from '../db';

async function addLink(link) {
  await db.links.add(link);
}
```

### Retrieving Links
To retrieve links from the database, you can use:

```typescript
async function getLinks() {
  return await db.links.toArray();
}
```

## Synchronizing Data
When the application comes back online, you may want to synchronize the data stored in Dexie with your remote database. You can listen for online/offline events:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('online', syncData);
window.addEventListener('offline', () => console.log('You are offline'));

async function syncData() {
  const links = await db.links.toArray();
  // Send links to the server and handle response
}
```

## Conclusion
Using Dexie allows your application to function smoothly in offline mode, providing a better user experience. By implementing the above methods, you can ensure that data is stored locally and synchronized when the user is back online.
